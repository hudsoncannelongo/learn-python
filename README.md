# 🧠 Hudson is Learning Python! 🐍

## Step 1: Think about what you want your code to do and break it down into smaller steps in simple english.

> (This is called **pseudocode** — it just explains the steps, not real code yet.)

**Example pseudocode:**

```python
# Ask the user for their name`
# Say hello to the user`
# Check if the entered username matches the saved username
```

---

## Step 2: Turn each line of pseudocode into real Python commands.

**Example translations:**

- **`# Ask the user for their name`** → In Python, you use `input()` to get typing from a user.

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```

- **`# Say hello to the user`** → In Python, you use `print()` to show something on the screen.

```python
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

- **`#Check if the entered username matches the saved username`** -> In python you use the `if` statement!

```python
if username == enteredUsername:
```

## Step 3: Test your code by running it!

See if it does what you wanted.

> If it doesn't, fix it. (That’s called **debugging**.) You can set a breakpoint and step through your code slowly.

> If it works, **congratulations**!

> You just turned your pseudocode into real code! WOW!

## 🔥 Remember Hudson:

- Each step of pseudocode usually becomes **1–2 lines** of real code.
- Use `input()` when you need the user to **type** something.
- Use `print()` when you want to **show** something back to the user.
- Use `if` statements when you want to **check** something.
- Use `while` when you want to keep running the same code over and over until you have what you want!
