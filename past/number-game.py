# 1. First, we need to get random numbers, so: import random

# 2. Make a variable that picks a random number between 1 and 10: random.randint(1, 10)

# 3. Ask the user to guess a number using input()
# Turn it into a number with int()

# 4. Use a while loop to loop every time the guess is NOT equal to the secret number

    # 5. If the guess is too high, print "Too high!"

    # 6. else If the guess is too low, print "Too low!"

    # 7. Ask again and get a new guess

# 8. When the guess is right, print "You got it!" in green
